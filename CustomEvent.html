<!-- 
    For our own, completely new events types like "hello" we should use new CustomEvent. Technically CustomEvent is the same as Event, with one exception.
    In the second argument (object) we can add an additional property detail for any custom information that we want to pass with the event.
    After an event object is created, we should “run” it on an element using the call elem.dispatchEvent(event).
